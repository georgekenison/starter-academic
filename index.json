As such, invariants provide inductive arguments that are key in automating the verification of program loops. The problem of generating loop invariants; in particular, invariants described by polynomial relations (so called polynomial invariants), is therefore one of the hardest problems in software verification. In this paper we advocate an alternative solution to invariant generation. Rather than inferring invariants from loops, we synthesise loops from invariants. As such, we generate loops that satisfy a given set of polynomials; in other words, our synthesised loops are correct by construction.\nOur work turns the problem of loop synthesis into a symbolic computation challenge. We employ techniques from algebraic geometry to synthesise loops whose polynomial invariants are described by pure difference binomials. We show that such complex polynomial invariants need ``only'' linear loops, opening up new venues in program optimisation. We prove the existence of non-trivial loops with linear updates for polynomial invariants generated by pure difference binomials. Importantly, we introduce an algorithmic approach that constructs linear loops from such polynomial invariants, by generating linear recurrence sequences that have specified algebraic relations among their terms.

Whilst the problem is in general undecidable, the goal is settled for restricted classes of loops. For the class of solvable loops, introduced by Kapur and Rodríguez-Carbonell in 2004, one can automatically compute invariants from closed-form solutions of recurrence equations that model the loop behaviour. In this paper we establish a technique for invariant synthesis for loops that are not solvable, termed unsolvable loops. Our approach automatically partitions the program variables and identifies the so-called defective variables that characterise unsolvability. We further present a novel technique that automatically synthesises polynomials, in the defective variables, that admit closed-form solutions and thus lead to polynomial loop invariants. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate both the feasibility and applicability of our approach to both deterministic and probabilistic programs.

A dynamical system is a state-based system that is specified by a rule specifying how the state changes over time (e.g., a swinging pendulum or a cobweb model of supply and demand in economics). While the study of dynamical systems permeates the quantitative sciences, in this talk we focus on computational aspects and their relevance to basic verification problems, such as termination and invariant synthesis. We highlight in particular certain problems that can be traced back to the program-analysis literature, e.g., concerning the decidability of termination for linear constraint loops and the computability of polyhedral and polynomial invariants for various classes of transition systems. In the talk we give some of the mathematical context of these problems, discuss recent progress, and highlight unsolved cases. The characteristic feature of the problems we consider is that they turn out to be much more challenging than they might first appear to the innocent-minded and in some cases have connections to problems at the frontiers of modern mathematics.\n","date":1649203200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649203200,"objectID":"d3034471fb54da77100c07ed5e059cfd","permalink":"https://georgekenison.github.io/post/dynamicaltalk/","publishdate":"2022-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/dynamicaltalk/","section":"post","summary":"James (Ben) Worrell gave a keynote talk on algorithmic analysis of dynamical systems at the 48th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2021).

The author includes the following insight by philosopher and mathematician Alfred North Whitehead:\nIt is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.\n(Alfred North Whitehead, 1911)\nIt is interesting to link Whitehead’s observation to schools of thought in mathematics education; that is, the academic study of didactical practice and learning outcomes in mathematics.\nCasual observation and anecdotal evidence suggest that the topic of effective learning in mathematics appears to be of little concern to many lecturers. Freudenthal offers the following observation: complete mastery of a topic separates some teachers from their learners.\nI have observed, not only with other people but also with myself. . . that sources of insight can be clogged by automatisms. One finally masters an activity so perfectly that the question of how and why [students have difficultly with these procedures] is not asked any more, cannot be asked any more, and is not even understood any more as a meaningful and relevant question.\n(Freudenthal)\nThere are many theories on how learners internalise and assimilate new mathematical concepts. We may relate Freudenthal’s automatisms to encapsulation, a term frequently used to indicate cognitive development. There are several theories in the literature that frame encapsulation from a constructivist epistemology of learning, these include: Dubinsky’s reactive abstraction for advanced mathematical thinking; APOS theory (Action, Process, Object, Schema) in Cottrill et al.; Sfard’s dual theory with its focus on rei\u000cfication; and Gray and Tall’s procepts (symbols may act as both processes and concepts in learners’ schemata). There are significant differences between these theories. For instance APOS theory and Sfard’s theory suggest that cognitive development of a learner’s schema is somewhat linear: Cottrill et al. believe learners encounter the stages Action, Process, Object, Schema in order; whilst Sfard identifies three separate stages interiorization, condensation and reifi\u000ccation.\nIt is interesting to question further the implications of good design (importing good practice from engineering and production) on teaching in higher education. The interface blending research, teaching, and learning has much to offer.\n","date":159624e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":159624e4,"objectID":"3e88ce4c595aa418f09c31fbc8d8911e","permalink":"https://georgekenison.github.io/post/designeveryday/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/designeveryday/","section":"post","summary":"In his book, The Design of Everyday Things, Norman argues that a skilled practitioner or expert minimises the cognitive burden of performing tasks by automating subroutines and processes.

Given a stochastic matrix $K\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{d\\times d}$ and positive $r\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, determine whether there exist an $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $K^n(1,2)=r$. That is to say, does there exist an $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that the probability of travelling from state $1$ to state $2$ is exactly $r$. The decidability of the Markov Reachability Problem is currently open.\nWe note the Markov Reachability Problem is more difficult than the process of determining whether there is a path of length $n$ originating at state $1$ and terminating at state $2$ with associated probability $r$.\nCycle graphs We shall consider the Markov Reachability Problem for a toy example. Let us define the entries of an $m\\times m$ stochastic matrix $K$ with rows and columns indexed by the states ${1,2,\\ldots, m}$ as follows\n\\begin{equation*} K(i,j) = \\begin{cases} p \u0026amp; \\text{if } j=i+1 \\pmod{m},\\\\ 1-p \u0026amp; \\text{if } j=i-1 \\pmod{m},\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} \\end{equation*}\nThe Markov chain associated to $K$ is a directed graph with states ${1,2,\\ldots, m}$ so that at each timestep the transitions $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell+1\\pmod{m}$ and $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell-1\\pmod{m}$ occur with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$, respectively.\nWe call the Markov chain associated to $K$ an $m$-cycle and, in addition, if $p\\neq 1/2$ we call the Markov chain a biased $m$-cycle. Without loss of generality, we shall assume throughout that $p\\in(0,1/2)$.\nThe biased $4$-cycle Consider the decidability of the Markov Reachability Problem for the biased $4$-cycle. It is clear that the only value of $r\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ that is not covered by stochastic asymptotic considerations is $r={1}/{2}$. We prove the following.\nProposition: Let $K$ be the stochastic transition matrix \\begin{equation*} K := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \u0026amp; p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1-p\\\\ 1-p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; p \u0026amp; 0\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1-p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; p\\\\ p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1-p \u0026amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{equation*} for the biased $4$-cycle with $p\\in(0,1/2)$. There is no $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ for which $K^m(1,2) = 1/2$.\nProof. Observe that a path originating at state $1$ and terminating at state $2$ on the $4$-cycle graph has odd length. We can categorise such paths by the number of state transitions $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell+1\\pmod{4}$ and $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell-1\\pmod{4}$ made.\nGiven that $K^{2m}(1,2)=0$ for each $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$. We need only consider two cases: paths with length $4m+1$ and those with length $4m+3$. We can write the entries $K^{4m+1}(1,2)$ and $K^{4m+3}(1,2)$ in terms of sums of odd binomial coefficients such that \\begin{align*} K^{4m+1}(1,2) \u0026amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^{2m} \\binom{4m+1}{2j+1} p^{2j+1}(1-p)^{4m-2j}, \\text{ and }\\\\\nK^{4m+3}(1,2) \u0026amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^{2m} \\binom{4m+3}{2j+2} p^{2j+2}(1-p)^{4m-2j+1}. \\end{align*}\nUsing standard techniques for binomial expansions we can express $K^{4n+1}(1,2)$ as follows \\begin{align*} 1- (1-2p)^{4m+1} \u0026amp;= (p + (1-p))^{4m+1} -(-p+(1-p))^{4m+1} \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^{4m+1} \\binom{4m+1}{j} p^j (1-p)^{4m+1-j} (1-(-1)^j) \\\\ \u0026amp;= 2\\sum_{j=0}^{2m} \\binom{4m+1}{2j+1} p^{2j+1} (1-p)^{4m-2j} \\\\ \u0026amp;= 2K^{4m+1}(1,2). \\end{align*}\nSuppose, for a contradiction, that there is an $m\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ for which $K^m(1,2)={1}/{2}$. Then $0 = K^m(1,2) - {1}/{2} = -(2p-1)^{m}/2$, but this contradicts our assumption that $p\\in(0,1/{2})$. The fact that there is no $m\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ for which $K^m(1,2) = 1/{2}$ follows by a similar argument. Thus we determine there is no $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ for which $K^m(1,2)=1/{2}$ as required.\nThe decidability of the Markov Reachability Problem for the fair $4$-cycle is trivial.

The one-day workshop will also celebrate the research contributions of Professor James Worrell (also known as Ben). For context, Ben is giving an invited talk at ICALP this year.\nCoincidentally, the workshop is a few days prior to Ben’s birthday. We are also planning to organise a birthday dinner as the closing event of the workshop, so please take this into consideration for planning your travel to Paderborn.\nProfessor James Worrell Confirmed Speakers Paul Bell (Keele) Valérie Berthé (CNRS, Paris) Florian Luca (Witwatersrand) Joël Ouaknine (MPI-SWS) Igor Potapov (Liverpool) Schedule To be announced\nOrganisers George Kenison (TU Wien) Mahsa Shirmohammadi (CNRS, Paris) ","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144e3,"objectID":"ca944d661acb7cca041cf421dc0b95bd","permalink":"https://georgekenison.github.io/worrell/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/worrell/","section":"","summary":"Workshop On Reachability, Recurrences, and Loops","tags":["Reachability","Recurrences","Loops","Workshop"],"title":"WORReLL'23","type":"page"},{"authors":["G.

We assume the graph is finite, connected and the degree of each vertex is at least three. Further, we assumean irrationality condition on the edge lengths. We obtain an asymptotic for the number of elements in a fixed conjugacy class for which the associated displacement of a given base vertex in the universal covering tree is at most $T$. Under a mild extra assumption we also obtain a polynomial error term.","tags":["orbit counting","symbolic dynamics","asymptotic properties of groups","free groups","metric trees","thermodynamic formalism"],"title":"Orbit counting in conjugacy classes for free groups acting on trees","type":"publication"}]
