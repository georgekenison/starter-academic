I am a research associate, at the Technische Universität Wien, working in formal verification and program analysis.  I was previously a research associate in infinite-state systems and dynamical systems at the University of Oxford.

My research interests span asymptotic properties of groups, symbolic dynamics, linear dynamical systems, verification, and decision problems. Much of my recent work considers the Skolem and Positivity Problems, two long-standing open decision problems, for recurrence sequences.
