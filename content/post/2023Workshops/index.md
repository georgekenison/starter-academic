I am co-organizing two workshops in July 2023: WORReLL'23  ([see here]({{< relref "/worrell" >}})) and Autobóz 2023 ([see here](https://autoboz.org/home-23)).

### WORReLL'23
WORRELL'23 is a one-day satellite workshop of at ICALP'23. 
The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers from the community and showcase cutting-edge research on _Reachability_, _Recurrences_, and _Loops_.

### Autobóz
Autobóz is a yearly week-long invitational research camp on Logic, Automata, and
Games. 

In 2023, Autobóz will take place at the Seminarhaus in the Hessische Staatsdomäne Frankenhausen the week between [ICALP](https://icalp2023.cs.upb.de/)  and [Highlights](https://highlights-conference.org/2023/). Indeed, Autobóz is excited to partnership with Highlights as part of the [Highlights Collaborative Research Week](https://highlights-conference.org/2023/hcrw).

We have solicited expert tutorials on topics as diverse as: _Circuit Verification using Computer Algebra_, _Decision Problems for Subclasses of Rational Relations_, and _Weak Memory Models in Concurrency_.
