## Workshop On Reachability, Recurrences, and Loops
### Satellite Workshop at [ICALP 2023](https://icalp2023.cs.upb.de/)
#### Paderborn, Germany
#### Monday 10th July 2023

---


## Topic



Recursively defined sequences are foundational objects of study in the computational sciences; they arise naturally in areas such as: the analysis of algorithms, weighted automata, loop termination, and probabilistic models. 

---

## Aim




The aim of WORReLL'23 is to bring together researchers from the community and showcase cutting-edge research on the above topics.
The one-day workshop will also celebrate the research contributions of Professor James Worrell (also known as Ben). For context, Ben is giving an [invited talk](https://icalp2023.cs.upb.de/invited-speakers/) at ICALP this year.





Coincidentally, the workshop is a few days prior to Ben's birthday.
We plan to celebrate with a birthday dinner on Sunday 09th July (the evening before the workshop), so please take this into consideration for planning your travel to Paderborn.

## Confirmed Speakers and Talks


#### [Nikhil Balaji](https://sites.google.com/view/nikhilbalaji/home) (IIT Delhi) _On the Complexity of the Sum of Square Roots Problem_  

Given positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$, the Sum of Square Roots
problem (SSR) is the computational problem of checking if $\sqrt{a_1} + \sqrt{a_2} + \dots + \sqrt{a_n} >  \sqrt{b_1} + \sqrt{b_2} + \dots + \sqrt{b_m}$.
It is an essential primitive in Computational Geometry where efficient algorithms for several geometric problems are known relative to SSR. 
However the best-known complexity upper bound for SSR is in the Counting Hierarchy (CH), and no non-trivial lower bounds are known. Over the last two decades, SSR-hardness has emerged as a useful tool to capture the "numerical hardness" of problems, especially in Game Theory and Verification. In this talk, I will introduce a variant of SSR and show efficient "non-uniform" algorithms for this problem.

#### [Valérie Berthé](https://www.irif.fr/~berthe/) (CNRS, Paris) _Recursive Sequences and Numeration_

In this lecture we revisit recursive sequences  from the view point  of numeration systems and their associated dynamical systems.
Linear recurrences allow indeed  the definition of  numerations for both integers and real numbers.
We focus on the so-called finiteness property  which  means that  the set  of elements having a finite  expansion   forms a ring, and on  its numerous applications in arithmetics, aperiodic order,  fractal geometry etc.
