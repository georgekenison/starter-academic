## Aim

The one-day workshop will celebrate the research contributions of Professor James Worrell (also known as Ben) to reachability problems and recurrence sequences. For context, Ben is giving an [invited talk](https://icalp2023.cs.upb.de/invited-speakers/) at ICALP this year.

Coincidentally, the workshop is a few days prior to Ben's birthday.
We are also planning to organise a birthday dinner as the closing event of the workshop, so please take this into consideration for planning your travel to Paderborn.
