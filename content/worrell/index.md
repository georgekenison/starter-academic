#### Paderborn, Germany
#### Monday 10th July 2023

## Topic

<br/>

Recursively defined sequences are foundational objects of study in the computational sciences; they arise naturally in areas such as: the analysis of algorithms, weighted automata, loop termination, and probabilistic models.

<br/>

The aim of WORReLL'23 is to bring together researchers from the community and showcase cutting-edge research on the above topics.
The one-day workshop will also celebrate the research contributions of Professor James Worrell (also known as Ben). For context, Ben is giving an [invited talk](https://icalp2023.cs.upb.de/invited-speakers/) at ICALP this year.

Coincidentally, the workshop is a few days prior to Ben's birthday.
We are also planning to organise a birthday dinner as the closing event of the workshop, so please take this into consideration for planning your travel to Paderborn.
