abstract: "  It is a longstanding open problem whether there is an algorithm to
decide the Positivity Problem for linear recurrence sequences (LRS)
over the integers, namely whether given such a sequence, all its terms
are non-negative. Decidability is known for LRS of order $5$ or less,
i.e., for those sequences in which every new term depends linearly on
the previous five (or fewer) terms. For *simple* LRS (i.e.,
those sequences whose characteristic polynomials have no repeated roots),
decidability of Positivity is known up to order $9$.

In this paper, we focus on the important subclass of
  *reversible* LRS, i.e., those integer LRS $\\langle u_n
  \\rangle_{n=0}^\\infty$ whose bi-infinite completion
  $\\langle u_n \\rangle_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty$ also takes exclusively
  integer values; a typical example is the classical Fibonacci
  (bi-)sequence $\\langle \\dots, 5, -3, 2, -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
  \\ldots \\rangle$. Our main results are that Positivity is decidable
  for reversible LRS of order $11$ or less, and for simple reversible
  LRS of order $17$ or less. "
