abstract: "Computational problems concerning the orbit of a point
under the action of a matrix group occur in numerous subfields
of computer science, including complexity theory, program analysis, quantum computation, and automata theory.
In many cases  the focus extends beyond orbits proper to orbit closures under a suitable topology.
Typically one starts from a group and several points and asks questions
about the orbit closure of the points under the action of the group, e.g., whether two given orbit closures intersect.


In this paper we consider a collection of what we call determination problems concerning groups and orbit closures.  These problems begin with  a given variety and 
seek to understand
whether and how it 
arises either as an algebraic group or as an orbit closure. 
The _how_ question asks whether the underlying group is $s$-generated, meaning it is topologically generated by $s$ matrices for a given number $s$. 
Among other applications,  problems of this type have recently been studied in the context of synthesising loops subject to certain specified invariants on program variables. 

Our main result is a polynomial-space procedure
that inputs a variety $V$ and a number $s$ and determines whether $V$ arises as an orbit closure of a point under 
an  $s$-generated commutative matrix group. 
The main tools in our approach are rooted in structural properties of commutative algebraic matrix groups and  lattice theory. We leave open the question of determining whether a variety is an 
orbit closure of a point under an algebraic matrix group (without the requirement of commutativity).  In this regard, we note that a recent paper by Nosan et al. gives an elementary procedure to compute the orbit closure of a point under finitely many matrices.
