abstract: "A rational-valued sequence is hypergeometric if it satisfies a first-order linear recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients.
In this note we discuss two decision problems, the membership and threshold problems, for hypergeometric sequences.
The former problem asks whether a chosen target is in the orbit of a given sequence, 
whilst the latter asks whether every term in a sequence is bounded from below by a given value.

We establish decidability results for restricted variants of these two decision problems with an approach via transcendental number theory.
Our contributions include the following: the membership and threshold problems are both decidable for the class of 
rational-valued hypergeometric sequences with Gaussian integer parameters."
