abstract: "The membership and threshold problems for recurrence sequences are
fundamental open decision problems in automated verification. The former
problem asks whether a chosen target is an element of a sequence, whilst the
latter asks whether every term in a sequence is bounded from below by a given
value.
  A rational-valued sequence $\\langle u_n \\rangle_n$ is hypergeometric if it
satisfies a first-order linear recurrence of the form $p(n)u_{n+1} = q(n)u_{n}$
with polynomial coefficients $p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. In this note we establish
decidability results for the aforementioned problems for restricted classes of
hypergeometric sequences. For example, we establish decidability for the
aforementioned problems under the assumption that the polynomial coefficients
$p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ are monic and split over an imaginary rational extension
of $\\mathbb{Q}$. We also establish conditional decidability results; that is,
conditional on Schanuel's conjecture, when the irreducible factors of the monic
polynomial coefficients $p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ are either linear or quadratic."
