abstract: "Automatically generating invariants, key to computer-aided analysis of probabilistic and
deterministic programs and compiler optimisation, is a challenging open problem. Whilst the problem
is in general undecidable, the goal is settled for restricted classes of loops. For the class of solvable loops, 
introduced by Kapur and Rodríguez-Carbonell in 2004, one can automatically compute invariants from closed-form solutions
 of recurrence equations that model the loop behaviour. In this paper we establish a technique for invariant synthesis
 for loops that are not solvable, termed unsolvable loops. Our approach automatically partitions the program variables
 and identifies the so-called defective variables that characterise unsolvability. We further present a novel technique 
that automatically synthesises polynomials, in the defective variables, that admit closed-form solutions and thus lead to 
polynomial loop invariants. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate both the feasibility and applicability of our 
approach to both deterministic and probabilistic programs.
