abstract: "Hypergeometric sequences obey first-order linear recurrence relations with polynomial coefficients and are commonplace throughout the mathematical and computational sciences.
For certain classes of hypergeometric sequences, we prove linear growth estimates on their Weil heights.
We give an application of our effective results, towards the Membership Problem from Computer Science.  Recall that Membership asks to procedurally determine whether a specificed target is an element of a given recurrence sequence.
