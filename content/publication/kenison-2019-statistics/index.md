abstract: "In this paper, we establish statistical results for a convex co-compact action of a free group on a CAT(âˆ’1) space where we restrict to a non-trivial conjugacy class in the group. In particular, we obtain a central limit theorem where the variance is twice the variance that appears when we do not make this restriction. "
