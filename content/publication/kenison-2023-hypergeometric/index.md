abstract: "Hypergeometric sequences are rational-valued sequences that satisfy
first-order linear recurrence relations with polynomial coefficients; that is,
a hypergeometric sequence $\\langle u_n \\rangle$ is one that
satisfies a recurrence of the form $f(n)u_n = g(n)u_{n-1}$ where $f,g \\in
\\mathbb{Z}[x]$.
  In this paper, we consider the Membership Problem for hypergeometric
sequences: given a hypergeometric sequence $\\langle u_n \\rangle$
and a target value $t\\in \\mathbb{Q}$, determine whether $u_n=t$ for some index
$n$. We establish decidability of the Membership Problem under the assumption
that either (i) $f$ and $g$ have distinct splitting fields or (ii) $f$ and $g$
are monic polynomials that both split over a quadratic extension of
$\\mathbb{Q}$. Our results are based on an analysis of the prime divisors of
polynomial sequences $\\langle f(n) \\rangle$ and $\\langle g(n)
\\rangle$ appearing in the recurrence relation."
