abstract: "We consider the open Stochastic Reachability Problem:  given a stochastic matrix $K\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{d\\times d}$, probability distributions $x,y\\in\\mathbb{Q}^d$, and a non-negative constant $r\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, determine whether there exists an $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $x^\\top K^n y =r$.
The restriction to random walks, the Markov Reachability Problem, is the task of determining whether
there exists an $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that the probability of travelling from a source state to a target state in $n$ steps is equal to $r$.
We establish decidability results for: walks on undirected graphs, hyperplane walks, Bernoulli walks on cycles, and circulant walks on certain finite groups. 
We illustrate this note with examples from self-organising lists and card shuffling.
