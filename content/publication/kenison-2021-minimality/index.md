abstract: "An infinite sequence $\\langle u_n \\rangle$ of real numbers is holonomic if it  satisfies a linear recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients.  Such a sequence is positive if each $u_n \\geq 0$, and minimal if, given  any other linearly independent sequence $\\langle v_n \\rangle$ satisfying the same  recurrence relation, the ratio $u_n/v_n$ converges to $0$ as $n$ tends to  infinity.
In this paper we establish a Turing reduction of the problem of deciding positivity of second-order  holonomic sequences to that of deciding minimality of such sequences.  More specifically, we give a procedure for determining positivity of  second-order holonomic sequences that terminates in all but an  exceptional number of cases, and we show that in these exceptional cases positivity can be determined using an oracle for deciding minimality."
