abstract: "The Skolem Problem asks, given a linear recurrence sequence $(u_n)$, whether there exists $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $u_n = 0$. In this paper we consider the following specialisation of the problem: given in addition $c\\in\\mathbb{N}$, determine whether there exists $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ of the form $n = lp^k$, with $k, l \\leq c$ and $p$ any prime number, such that $u_n = 0$."
