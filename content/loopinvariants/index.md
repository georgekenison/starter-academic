## Aim




Reasoning about loops is a fundamental task in program analysis and verification.  To this end, loop invariants are an indispensable tool.  They help both to establish safety properties (e.g., proofs of non-reachability) and liveness properties (e.g., as supporting invariants in termination proofs). Beyer et al. [[VMCAI 2007]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-69738-1_27) go so far as to call the problem of automatic invariant generation ''the most important task in program verification. ''

 

There has been a resurgence of interest in computing the polynomial invariants for loops. In one direction, theoretical work has produced complete algorithms that will generate the invariant ideal for abstract classes of loops. In another direction, recent works have produced templates and heuristics aimed at generating some (but not necessarily all) the invariants of more general classes of loops with conditional branching, polynomial assignments, and probabilistic updates.

 

This workshop aims to span the divide between the aforementioned directions and bring together researchers from both communities.

Abstract: Given positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$, the Sum of Square Roots
problem (SSR) is the computational problem of checking if $$\sqrt{a_1} + \sqrt{a_2} + \dots + \sqrt{a_n} >  \sqrt{b_1} + \sqrt{b_2} + \dots + \sqrt{b_m}.$$
It is an essential primitive in Computational Geometry where efficient algorithms for several geometric problems are known relative to SSR. 
However the best-known complexity upper bound for SSR is in the Counting Hierarchy (CH), and no non-trivial lower bounds are known. Over the last two decades, SSR-hardness has emerged as a useful tool to capture the "numerical hardness" of problems, especially in Game Theory and Verification. In this talk, I will introduce a variant of SSR and show efficient "non-uniform" algorithms for this problem.
